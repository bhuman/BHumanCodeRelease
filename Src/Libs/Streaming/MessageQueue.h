/**
 * @file MessageQueue.h
 *
 * This file declares a class that represents a bag of streamed data. In the
 * context of this class, each entry is called a message. A message has a type
 * that is represented as a value of the enumeration type \c MessageID. It also
 * has a size. Messages are stored sequentially in a single block of memory.
 * They basically form a single linked list with their size information
 * functioning as the links. Given this structure, the class provides two
 * abstractions in its interface.
 * One the one hand, it stores a block of memory, i.e. it works on bytes.
 * \c reserve() allows to reserve a maximum size, \c size() returns the
 * currently used size, and \c resize() allows the shrink the used size (all in
 * bytes). Also, the iterator arithmetics \c += , \c -= , \c + , and \c - all
 * work on bytes.
 * On the other hand, the iterator operator \c ++ allows to walk through the
 * memory block message-wise and its operator \c * returns an object that
 * represents a single message that can be opened as a stream (using either
 * \c bin() or \c text() ). The three functions \c bin() , \c text() , and
 * \c textRaw() of the message queue itself allow to open a writable stream
 * to append a single message. A message must be completely written before a
 * stream for the next message is requested.
 * If the message queue is already full, messages that should be appended are
 * dropped. Since some messages are more relevant than others, the message
 * queue also supports a protected capacity that is reserved for the more
 * important messages. So some message types are dropped earlier than others.
 * Usually, the memory block containing the messages is maintained by the
 * message queue. However, it is also possible to set an external memory block
 * to support the use of a memory-mapped file as (read-only) storage.
