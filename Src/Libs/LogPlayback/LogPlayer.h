/**
 * @file LogPlayer.h
 *
 * This file declares a log player that records or plays back log files. It is
 * based on a message queue that stores the actual data. While the message
 * queue allows to access messages through iterators, this class manages the
 * messages as frames, which can be accessed through an index. The log player
 * is connected to a target message queue to which it copies messages to play
 * them back.
 * Most of the functionality is available if a log was loaded from a file. A
 * more limited set of methods can be used if the log player is recording a log
 * by itself. The reason is that several indices are computed for the logged
 * data, and since this is a costly operation, they are only created after
 * opening a log file and after a few selected operations that can usually be
 * applied to logs that were loaded from disk.
 * When loading a log file from disk, the log player tries to directly map the
 * file into the message queue, which means that the log file does need to be
 * loaded completely. When a log file is opened for the first time, indices are
 * computed and appended to the file. Further uses can directly load these
 * indices to avoid recreating them and thereby going through the whole log
 * file.
