//! Algorithms and precomputed tables to find objects in a calibrated stereo image pair
/*! The detector detects objects given by a \c TriangleMesh in a
    calibrated stereo image pair. Therefor, it precomputes possible
    contours of the object in different poses and searches in the
    stereo image for a contours that has a high response.  It searches
    simultaneously in the left and right image, i.e. the response of a
    contour corresponding to a particular pose in the left image is
    added to the corresponding response of the object with the same
    pose in the right image.  This greatly increases robustness.

    The detector uses the contrast-normalized-Sobel (CNS, \c CNSResponse)
    method to evaluate in an linear illumination invariant way how
    well a given hypothetical contour is actually present in the image.
