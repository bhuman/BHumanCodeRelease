//! Algorithms and precomputed data-structures to perform ShapeCNSDetector::rasterize efficiently
/*! The current implementation supports only distortion-free cameras.

    There is a 3-D table mapping the camera position in object coordinates to the
    list of edges visible. There is also an optimized implementation that perspectively
    projects the vertices of these edges computes there center and normal and stores
    that as a point in a \c CodedContour. This means the \c LutRasterizer only computes
    sparse contours.
