/**
 * @file SimulatedNao/Views/ImageView.h
 *
 * This file declares a view that displays an image overlaid by debug drawing.
 * Such a view is usually associated with a thread. It displays an image provided
 * by that thread. It prefers drawings originating from its associated thread. It
 * ignores drawings from other threads if the associated thread could also provide
 * them, but currently does not. It is also possible to create a view without an
 * image. Such a view can also be independent from a specific thread.
