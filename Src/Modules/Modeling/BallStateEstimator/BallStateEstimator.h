/**
 * @file BallStateEstimator.h
 *
 * For ball tracking in the RoboCup context, multiple tasks need to be solved:
 *   1. Filtering and clustering the detected balls (i.e. the BallPercepts) to avoid
 *      the use of any false positive, which might lead to severe problems.
 *   2. Detecting collisions of the ball and the robot.
 *   3. Estimating a precise position as well as a velocity based on a set of recent
 *      ball observations and collision information.
 *
 * This module provides a solution for task 3: State estimation.
 *
 * The module declared in this file is based on the implementation that has been used by
 * B-Human for multiple years: estimating the ball position and velocity by maintaining
 * a set of normal Kalman filters.
 * It is a re-implementation of the module used during RoboCup 2018.
