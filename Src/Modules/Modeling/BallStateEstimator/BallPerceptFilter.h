/**
 * @file BallPerceptFilter.h
 *
 * For ball tracking in the RoboCup context, two tasks need to be solved:
 *   1. Filtering and clustering the detected balls (i.e. the BallPercepts) to avoid
 *      the use of any false positive, which might lead to severe problems.
 *   2. Estimating a precise position as well as a velocity based on a set of recent
 *      ball observations.
 * In previous implementations, these two tasks have been combined within one module. For more
 * clarity and more flexibility, both tasks are split into two modules now.
 * In addition, collision detection between feet and ball has been moved to a third model.
 *
 * This module provides a solution for task 1: Filtering and clustering BallPercepts.
 *
 * The module declared in this file is based on the basic filtering implementation that has been used by
 * B-Human inside the BallLocator module in recent years.
