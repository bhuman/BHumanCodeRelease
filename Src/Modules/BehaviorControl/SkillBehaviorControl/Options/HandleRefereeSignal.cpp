/**
 * @file HandleRefereeSignal.h
 *
 * This file defines an option that handles the detection of referee signals
 * in the standby state and during kick-ins. A robot only tries to look at
 * the referee if it stands inside a ring segment surrounding the referee
 * position, when a state starts that requires detecting a referee signal.
 * The detection stops when any robot on the team detects an expected
 * referee signal, a timeout is reached, or the state ends. In case of a
 * kick-in, the robot will turn in the direction of the referee if just
 * turning the head is not sufficient.
