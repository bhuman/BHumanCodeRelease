/**
 * @file PenaltyAreaAndGoalAreaPerceptor.h
 *
 * Declaration of module that tries to find the penalty area in the current field percepts.
 * The module searches two different combinations of field lines and intersections and computes a field feature if
 * one of those is found.
 *
 * The first approach is looking for three parallel lines, corresponding to the goal-, goal area- and penalty area lines, and either corner of the penalty area (A or D).
 * The second approach is used, if the first is not successful and looks for two intersections, corresponding to the penalty area and goal area (A and B or C and D).
 *
