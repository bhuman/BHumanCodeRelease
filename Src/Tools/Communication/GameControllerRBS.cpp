  // Invalidate the previous synchronization if it doesn't explain the received message.
  // This is necessary to avoid using an old (and very wrong) offset if the other robot
  // has been restarted in the meantime (in case they cannot be synchronized immediately
  // based on this message).
  // We use the current system time as receive time because it is surely later than the
  // actual receive time and `maxTeamMessageSendReceiveDelay` contains some buffer for this.
  // (`theFrameInfo.time` is a camera timestamp and can thus be earlier than the actual
  // receive time.)
  remoteSMB.validate(m.timestamp, Time::getCurrentSystemTime());

  // The following is based on the following considerations:
  // - If the GameController sends a packet with number $i$, each robot will either not receive it or
  //     receive it at a timestamp which only differs due to the time spent on the receiver until the
  //     timestamp is taken (but not due to delay on the sender or channel, because they are the same
  //     for all receivers).
  // - Team messages contain a pair of (packet number, receive timestamp). Since we assume that all
  //     receive timestamps of a given packet are actually taken at the same instant (+- receiver delay),
  //     the difference between the remote and local receive timestamps of the same GC packet is
  //     the clock difference.
  // - This leaves the following questions:
  //   - If a robot receives a team message which references packet number $i$, how can it be sure that,
  //       given it has a packet with number $i$ in its buffer of received GC packets, this packet is
  //       *actually* the same?
  //     - reasons why this can occur:
  //       - GameController is restarted
  //       - multiple GameControllers (?)
  //         - This isn't actually as bad, as long as both robots receive both GameControllers.
  //     - The GameController sends two packets every second. Therefore, it takes more than two minutes
  //         until the packet number wraps around. Therefore, a maximum age for buffer entries prevents
  //         this.
  //   - If a robot receives a team message which references packet number $i$, what should it do if it
  //       doesn't have a packet with number $i$ in its buffer of received GC packets?
  //     - reasons why this can occur:
  //       - no GameController running (anymore)
  //       - receiver didn't get the GC packet (got lost)
  //         - In theory, the receiver could interpolate between adjacent packets, but this would be very
  //             imprecise and introduce exactly the kind of errors that we are avoiding by synchronizing
  //             on the *same* packet. Therefore, we have to accept this case.
  //       - receiver didn't get the GC packet *yet*
  //         - On the network level, the team message cannot "overtake" the GC packet.
  //             In each frame, this function is called *after* new GameController packets have been received.
  //             This means that, in order to get a team message that references a GC packet that
  //             has not been received yet (but will be received later), the following sequence of events
  //             must occur:
  //             1. GameControlDataProvider on this robot fetches latest GC packet
  //             2. GameControlDataProvider on other robot newer GC packet
  //             3. other robot sends team message referencing the new GC packet
  //             4. TeamMessageHandler on this robot received that team message (in the same frame as 1).
  //             Because (2) happens at the beginning of a frame on the other robot and (3) at its end,
  //             the frame must be significantly shorter on the other robot than on this robot. Therefore
  //             this case is *very* unlikely to happen :fingers_crossed:

  // The sender didn't receive any GameController packet recently. In that case, we cannot
  // calculate a new offset, i.e. we either keep the old offset if there is a valid one or
  // we stay unsynchronized.
