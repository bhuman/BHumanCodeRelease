/* Odometry table for MotionNetSpecialActions Module
* Contains one entry for all defined special actions.
* Odometry can be either specified as complete resulting movement of one execution of a motion
* for inhomogeneous motions with fixed execution time e.g. kicks, or as speeds of a
* homogeneous movement which are integrated while the motion is executed e.g. for walking.
*
* Format
*  {
*    id = <SpecialActionID>;
*    type = <none,once,homogeneous>;
*    [odometryOffset = {
*      translation = {
*        x = <movement,speed>;
*        y = <movement,speed>;
*      };
*      rotation = <rotation>;
*    };]
*    isMotionStable = <true,false>;
*  }
*
* Examples:
*  {
*    id = sit;
*    type = none;
*    isMotionStable = true;
*  },  no movement
*  {
*    id = kick;
*    type = once;
*    odometryOffset = {
*      translation = {
*        x = 50;
*        y = 0;
*      };
*      rotation = 0;
*    };
*    isMotionStable = false;
*  },  executing motion once produces forward movement of 50 mm
*  {
*    id = run;
*    type = homogeneous;
*    odometryOffset = {
*      translation = {
*        x = 200;
*        y = 0;
*      };
*      rotation = 0;
*    };
*    isMotionStable = true;
*  },  moving forward with constant speed of 200 mm s
