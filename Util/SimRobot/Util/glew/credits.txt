GLEW was developed by Milan Ikits and Marcelo Magallon. They also perform
occasional maintainance to make sure that GLEW stays in mint condition. Aaron
Lefohn, Joe Kniss, and Chris Wyman were the first users and also assisted with
the design and debugging process. The acronym GLEW originates from Aaron
Lefohn. Pasi Kärkkäinen identified and fixed several problems with GLX and
SDL. Nate Robins created the wglinfo utility, to which modifications were made
by Michael Wimmer.
