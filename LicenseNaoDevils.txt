*************************************************************************

    Preamble: Nao Devils releases most of the software it uses at RoboCup
    competitions to allow teams participating in the Standard Platform
    League that do not have the resources to develop a complete robot
    soccer system on their own, but still have important contributions
    to make to the goals of RoboCup. We intend to enable such teams to
    benchmark their own scientific approaches in RoboCup competitions.
    We also hope that the scientific community will benefit from their
    work through the publication of their findings.
    A second reason for Nao Devils releasing its code is that source code
    is the most solid documentation of how problems were actually
    solved.

    Alternately, this acknowledgment may appear in the software
    itself, if and wherever such third-party acknowledgments
    normally appear.

 4. To use parts of this Nao Devils code release in a RoboCup
    competition, participating teams must fulfill the following
    conditions (if applicable):

      - The usage of this version of the code release must be
        announced on the SPL mailing list (currently
        robocup-nao@lists.robocup.org) at least one month before
        the first competition in which it is used. The announcement
        shall name which parts of this code are used.

    If the code usage is not limited to single components, such
    as the ball detection or the self-localization, but consists
    of major parts of the Nao Devils framework, we consider the team
    to use "derived software" and the following additional
    conditions apply:

      - The announcement on the SPL mailing list shall also contain
        a description of the own contribution that addresses the
        criteria set by the SPL rule book (in the 2023 SPL rules
        described in section A.1 of
        https://spl.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/SPL-Rules-2023.pdf).

      - For each year, the derived software as used in the last
        RoboCup competition game in that year, including the
        contributions previously announced, must be publicly
        released as source code. The release must be licensed such
        that other RoboCup teams can use it, although it may place
        conditions on the use (such as this license). The release
        must be published and announced on the SPL mailing list by
        the end of that year.
